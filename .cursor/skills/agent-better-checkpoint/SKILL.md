# Agent Better Checkpoint — Semantic Git Commits for AI Sessions

You are an AI coding assistant with **checkpoint awareness**. Every meaningful edit you make should be committed as a transparent Git checkpoint, so the user has a clear, operable history of all changes.

**Core Principle**: Replace opaque checkpoints with transparent Git commits. Every meaningful edit gets a semantic commit message that explains *what* changed and *why*.

---

## 🔧 Installation Check

Before your first commit, verify the checkpoint scripts are available.

**IMPORTANT: Use your file-listing/read tools (NOT shell `test -f`) to check existence.** Shell relative paths break when CWD ≠ workspace root.

Check in order (stop at first hit):
1. **Project-local (preferred):** `.vibe-x/agent-better-checkpoint/checkpoint.sh` (or `.ps1`) relative to workspace root.
2. **Global fallback:** `~/.vibe-x/agent-better-checkpoint/scripts/checkpoint.sh` (or `.ps1`).

Both `.sh` and `.ps1` are always installed regardless of current OS.

If neither exists, run:

```bash
npx @vibe-x/agent-better-checkpoint@0.3.3
```

Without `--target`: installs globally. With `--target .`: project-only (skill + hooks in `.cursor/`, scripts in `.vibe-x/`), no global changes.

## 🔄 When to Commit

### MUST Commit After:
- Completing a logical unit of work (implementing a function, fixing a bug, adding a feature)
- Making a significant refactor or restructuring
- Adding or modifying configuration files
- Creating or updating documentation
- Before switching to a different task or file group
- Before ending the conversation (the stop hook will remind you if you forget)

### Do NOT Commit After:
- Trivial whitespace-only changes
- Incomplete changes with syntax errors
- Changes you're about to immediately undo

---

## 📝 Commit Message Format

Use **Conventional Commits** with `checkpoint` type:

```
checkpoint(<scope>): <short description>

<detailed description of changes, intent, and context>
```

### Rules:
1. **Subject line**: `checkpoint(<scope>): <description>`
   - `<scope>`: affected area (e.g., `auth`, `api`, `config`, `ui`, `docs`)
   - `<description>`: imperative mood, lowercase, ≤72 chars
2. **Body** (after blank line): Explain what changed and why. Include context about intent.
3. **Do NOT** include trailers or metadata — the checkpoint script appends those automatically.

### Good Examples:

```
checkpoint(api): add user registration endpoint

Implement POST /api/users with email/password validation.
Includes bcrypt hashing and duplicate email check.
```

```
checkpoint(config): enable TypeScript strict mode

Enable strict null checks and no-implicit-any rules.
Aligns with the team's TypeScript migration plan.
```

```
checkpoint(ui): fix responsive layout on mobile

Sidebar was overlapping main content on screens < 768px.
Switch to flex-column layout with collapsible sidebar.
```

## 🛠️ How to Commit

Call the checkpoint script after composing your message. Both `.sh` and `.ps1` are always available — pick the one matching the current OS.

**Prefer project-local when present**, fall back to global:

| OS | Project-local | Global fallback |
|----|--------------|-----------------|
| macOS/Linux | `.vibe-x/agent-better-checkpoint/checkpoint.sh` | `~/.vibe-x/agent-better-checkpoint/scripts/checkpoint.sh` |
| Windows | `powershell -File ".vibe-x\agent-better-checkpoint\checkpoint.ps1"` | `powershell -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.vibe-x\agent-better-checkpoint\scripts\checkpoint.ps1"` |

### Parameters:

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| message (1st arg) | Yes | Full commit message (subject + blank line + body) |
| user-prompt (2nd arg) | No | The user's original prompt/request |
| `--type` / `-Type` | No | `auto` (default) or `fallback` |

### Example (macOS/Linux):

```bash
.vibe-x/agent-better-checkpoint/checkpoint.sh \
  "checkpoint(auth): add JWT token refresh logic

Implement automatic token refresh when access token expires.
Uses refresh token rotation for security." \
  "帮我实现 token 刷新机制"
```

### Example (Windows):

```powershell
powershell -File ".vibe-x\agent-better-checkpoint\checkpoint.ps1" `
  "checkpoint(auth): add JWT token refresh logic`n`nImplement automatic token refresh when access token expires.`nUses refresh token rotation for security." `
  "帮我实现 token 刷新机制"
```

### What the script does:
1. Truncates user prompt to ≤60 characters (head...tail)
2. Appends Git Trailers: `Agent`, `Checkpoint-Type`, `User-Prompt`
3. Runs `git add -A && git commit`
4. Exits gracefully if there are no changes

---

## ⚡ Workflow

```
1. User gives you a task
2. You make edits (code, config, docs, etc.)
3. When a logical unit is complete → compose checkpoint message → call script
4. Continue with next task → repeat step 2-3
5. Conversation ends → stop hook verifies nothing is left uncommitted
```

This should feel natural — commit as you go, like any good developer.

---

## 🚨 Important Rules

- **One commit per logical change** — don't batch unrelated changes into one commit
- **Always commit before ending** — the stop hook catches missed commits, but proactive is better
- **Be descriptive** — future humans (and AI) will read these messages
- **Don't force empty commits** — the script handles "no changes" gracefully
- **Scope matters** — choose a meaningful scope that helps categorize the change
